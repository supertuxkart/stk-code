  <!--  interval: How long a single bounce takes.
        max-height: The maximum height of a bounce.
        min-height: Unused mostly, but defines implicitly
                    the starting height (as average of
                    max and min height).
        target-distance: When the ball is closer than 
                    this to the target, it will aim
                    directly at the target.
        target-max-angle: Once the ball is aiming for its
                    target, it can at most change the angle
                    this much per second(!).
        time-between-balls:  Reduces the frequency with which rubber 
                    balls are found to 1 every 'timer' seconds.
        min-interpolation-distance: how far the control
                    points (which are center of squads)
                    must be from each other. A large value
                    allows smoother turning (no abrupt
                    change of direction), but a large
                    value can result in the ball being
                    off track (e.g. a value of 30 results
                    on the ramp in sand track that the 
                    ball goes to the left of the tunnel,
                    bouncing on the pyramid). Quite
                    catastrophal on the startrack and
                    skyline).
        squash-slowdown: How much karts that are 
                    squashed are slowed down.
        squash-duration: How long karts stay squashed.
        delete-timer: How long before the ball is removed
                    if no suitable target is found.
        early-target-factor: the rubber ball can use the
                    relative position of the kart to the
                    center of the track for improved targeting
                    (i.e. the ball will align its relative
                    position to the center of the track early).
                    This allows a lower target-distance to be
                    used since the ball is better aligned,
                    hopefully reducing the frequency of 
                    tunneling.

  <!-- Distribution of the items depending on position of the 
       kart (first kart, top 33%, middle 33%, bottom 33% (but
       not last), last kart. i
       The order of items must correspond to powerup_manager.hpp.
       The first line (w=...) corresponds to the weights of 
       getting a single item, the second line (w-multi) to 
       getting three identical items instead of just a single one.
       E.g. as the first kart, you have 3/8 of a chance to get
       a single bubble gum, 1/8 to get a bowling ball or switch,
       and 3/8 to get a triple bubble gum.
       'Global' items which affect all karts (switch) should
       be quite rare, since otherwise the item might be used
       too often (compared with many items which will only
       affect a karts or two).                                -->
