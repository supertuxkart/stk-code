<!-- Format
    It is possible to give relative values (factors and more) for each property.

    The format as a regex is: ([+-*/](%d+|x))*
    An empty value means no change, a value without sign or with a '-' replaces
    the previous value. If an operator prefixes the string, e.g. *1.5 (- doesn't
    work because it's a sign). x will get replaced by the previous value which
    means *1.5 is equal to x*1.5. It's also possible to combine operations:
    +1.5*20 means "add 1.5 to the previous value and then multiply by 20".
    Note that it's computed sequentially from left to right and there is no
    operator precedence. Also whitespaces aren't allowed because they are used
    to split arrays.
    If you want to return the square of something use x*x or only *x.

    ATTENTION: '-' is a special case if it is the first character of a number-
    string. It means that the number is negative and NOT that the following
    float will be subtracted from the base value. So if x = 10 and the string
    "-5" is processed, the result will be -5 and not the same as "x-5", which
    would result in 10 - 5 = 5.

        <!-- Values related to stability of the chassis: damping, and reduced

            downward-impulse-factor: A speed proportional impulse applied each

            track-connection-accel: An artificial force that pulls a wheel to
                the ground if its off ground. Reduces the affect if a kart loses

            angular-factor: Factor to change angular impulses. X and Z rotations
                are damped to avoid that karts in a collision are too easily pushed

        <!-- Turning
            radius: The turn radius of the kart at
                a given speed. The actual steering angle is dependent on the
                wheel base of the kart: radius = wheel_base/sin(steering_angle).
                The values below define that at speed 0 the turn radius is 3, at
                speed 4 the radius is 3.6, at speed 8 the radius is 5, etc.
                The actual turn radius is piece-wise linearly interpolated. This
                allows for tighter turning at lower speeds. If the speed is higher
                than the highest defined one in the turn-radius array, the radius
                will be the same as at this highest defined speed. For example,
                a speed of 55 will have the same turn radius as the speed of 50
                for which a turn radius value is defined below.
            time-full-steer: This is the amount of change in steering depending
                on current steering. So if the steering is between 0 and 0.5,
                the time-for-steering-change is 0.17. If the current steering is
                between 0.5 and 1.0, the time-for-steering-change is 0.28.
                The speed is used as dt/time-for-steering-change.
                In short: steering at less than halfway is somewhat faster,
                but slower when you want to steer more, which should avoid
                oversteering (by pressing the key for too long)
                If the kart is currently in the direction opposite to the
                required steering ("negative steering"), the time-full-steer
                at 0 is used.
            speed-factor: The real speed of the kart is multiplied by this factor
                before checking the turn radius tables. This is meant to be used
                by difficulty settings or handicap, so that differences in turning
                abilities between kart classes keep more relevance even with
                lower overall speeds.
            speed-factor-partial-lb/ub: below the lower-bound, the speed-factor
                is not applied (it's 1.0), above the upper-bound the speed-factor
                is fully applied. It is recommended to set them to speeds which
                serve as reference points for the radius array (otherwise, values
                outside of the defined bounds will also be affected), and it is
                crucial to ensure that speed-factor-partial-ub divided by the highest
                possible speed-factor (with default speed-factor settings 1.4336)
                is higher than speed-factor-partial-lb, preferrably significantly
                so to avoid small speed increases having a strong effect on turn
                radius.

            max-speed: The base maximum speed of the kart in m/s
            generic-max-speed: Must have the same value as max-speed. This

            time-till-max: Time till maximum skidding is reached.
            visual: Additional graphical rotation of kart. The graphical rotation
                of the kart also determines the direction the kart is driving to
                when skidding is stopped.

                The additional engine force is not active during fade-out.
            bonus-force: Additional engine force (this is used to offset the fact
                that turning after skidding (e.g. to correct direction) often uses
                up the skid bonus).
            post-skid-rotate-factor: a factor to be used to determine how much
