    <p>
      Supertuxkart is a free 3D kart racing game, with a focus on having fun over
      realism. You can play with up to 4 friends on one PC, racing against each
      other, or try to beat the computer in single-player mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      See the great lighthouse or drive through the sand and visit the pyramids.
      Race underground or in space, watching the stars pass by. Or rest under the
      palm trees on the beach, watching the other karts overtake you. But don't eat
      the bananas! Watch for bowling balls, plungers, bubble gum and cakes thrown by
      your opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can do a single race against other karts, compete in one of several Grand
      Prix, try to beat the high score in time trials on your own, play battle mode
      against the computer or your friends, and more!
