           when skidding is stopped.
         visual-time: How long it takes for the visual skid to reach maximum.
         revert-visual-time: how long it takes when stopping a skid to revert

    <!-- Kart-specific settings used by the AI.
         use-slipstream: if the AI should try to overtake karts using slipstream.
         disable-slipstream-usage: even if the AI is not trying to use slipstream,
           it can get a lot of bonus, esp. on easy since the AI creates trains.
           Set this to true to make sure AI does not get any slipstream bonus.
         false-start-probability: Probability of a false start.
         min/max-start-delay: Minimum and maximum start delay.
           See http://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime/stats.php
           Average reaction time is around 0.215 s.
         nitro-usage: "none", "some", "all": if nitro should be used, and
           how much the AI should try to use it good.
         non-random-item-usage: If true, use items in a sophisticated way,
           otherwise use items randomly.
         collect-avoid-items: if the AI should collect and avoid items,
           or just ignore them.
         handle-bomb: If the AI should actively try to pass on a bomb.
         skidding-threshold: only for old-style skidding: when sharp turn
           should be triggered. Smaller values means it will sharp turn
           earlier, resulting in better driving in thight curves.


         max-item-angle: Items that would need more than this change in
           direction are not considered for collection.
         time-full-steer is the time for the AI to go from neutral steering to
           extreme left (or right). This can be used to reduce 
           'shaking' of AI karts caused by changing steering direction
           too often. It also helps with making it easier to push the
           AI karts (otherwise micro-corrections make this nearly
           impossible). A value of 1/maxFPS / 2 will guarantee that
           the wheel can go from -1 to +1 steering in one frame, 
           basically  disabling this mechanism.
         bad-item-closeness is the maximum distance between a good and a
           bad item which can force the AI to abandon a good item in order
           to avoid hitting a bad item. If the distance is larger, it is
           assumed that there will be enough time to change steering
           direction.
         straight-length-for-zipper is the minimum length a straight
           section of the track should have in order to activate a zipper.

           competitive when ahead of the player, or more competitive
           when behind the player. 

         skid-probability: Since the AI is usually very good at using
           skidding, this is used to implement some rubber-banding for
           the AI: depending on distance to the player, the AI will
           change the probability of skidding. This attributes takes
           a space-separated list of "distance:probability" pairs
           (negative distances meaning the kart is behind the player,
           a positive number that the AI is ahead of the player).
           Then list should have at least 2 entries. Depending on
           the actualy distance the kart has the probability is then
           linearly interpolated (if the AI is more than the largest
           distance ahead, the value for the largest distance is used,
           and similarly if the kart is more than the minimum value
           behind).
         speed-cap: Fraction of maximum speed the kart should drive
           at. Used to slow down karts that are ahead of the player.
           Note that setting this to a value >1 does NOT increase
           the speed the kart can drive at!
         collect-item-probability: Probability of the AI actually
           trying to collect an item (if an item is selected for
           collection in the first place).

    <!-- collision
         impulse: an additional impulse to be applied in a non-frontal
           collision to push two karts away from each other.
         impulse-time: The impulse will be applied over a certain time
           period, which results in less abrupt changes. If set to 0,
           the impulse is only applied once.
         resitution: restitution value to be used for the kart rigid bodies.
         bevel-factor: for each point of the chassis collision box one 
           additional point is added, resulting in a bevelled box shape.
           The original Z coordinate of the chassis is multiplied by 
           1-bevelZ (i.e. the main box part of the shape is shortened).
           The bevel point has the original Z coordinate, and the X and 
           Y coordinates of the box are multiplied with (1-bevelX) and 
           (1-bevelY).  A value of 0 for all bevel coordinates disables
           bevelling, and uses a simple box shape.
           As an example, a value of 1 for x and z will result in a 
           sharp 'arrow' like shape.  -->
