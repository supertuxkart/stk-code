  <!-- Physics
       smooth-normals: If the normals (for wheel raycasts) should be smoothened.
          This is a global setting, it still needs to be activated for each
          track individually.
       smooth-angle-limits: If the angle between the normal of a vertex and
          the normal of a triangle are larger than this value, the normal
          of the triangle will be used in interpolating the normals. This
          has the effect of an edge split modifier - if the flat track and (say)
          a wall at a 90 egree angle are not separated, the normal at that
          vertex will be 45 degrees, resulting in completely wrong physics.
          The angle limit in this case will discard the 45 degrees, and use
          the normal of the flat triangle (pointing upwards). In the worst
          case (all three normals discarded, the interpolation will just
          return the normal of the triangle (i.e. de facto no interpolation),
          but it helps making smoothing much more useful without fixing tracks.
      fps: The physics timestep size
      default-track-friction: Default friction to be used for the track and
          any track/library pbject.
      default-moveable-friction: Default friction to be used for any moveable,
          e.g. karts, bowling balls, ...
      solver-iteation: Number of solver iterations. A lower number reduces
          the quality, but can reduce bouncing effect.
      solver-split-impulse:: by default bullet solves for velocity and
          position at the same time, which can introduce bounce. Setting
          this to 1 can reduce bounce.
      solver-split-impulse-threshold: Penetration threshold for using split
          impulse (ignored if solver-split-impulse is false).
      solver-mode: Bullet's solver mode is a bit mask, which can be modified.
          This entry contains a space-separated list of mode-names to either
          set or unset in this bit mask. Any name starting with a '-' indicate
          that the bit is to be set to 0, otherwise the bit will be set.

       This field takes two
          values: the first value is 'and'ed with bullet's default values
          (i.e. it can be used to unset bullet defaults), the second value
          is 'or'ed (i.e. is used to set a bit). A value of -1 for 'and'
          means to keep all bits. The valid names are listed in stk_config.cpp
          and correspond to the definitions in btContactSolverInfo.h, e.g.:
          'randomized_order' corresponds to the bit SOLVER_RANDMIZE_ORDER.

  <!-- Kart-specific settings used by the AI.
         use-slipstream: if the AI should try to overtake karts using slipstream.
         disable-slipstream-usage: even if the AI is not trying to use slipstream,
           it can get a lot of bonus, esp. on easy since the AI creates trains.
           Set this to true to make sure AI does not get any slipstream bonus.
         shield-incoming-radius: Radius at which projectiles will be detected and
           trigger a shield usage.
         false-start-probability: Probability of a false start.
         min/max-start-delay: Minimum and maximum start delay.
           See http://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime/stats.php
           Average reaction time is around 0.215 s.
         nitro-usage: Integer determining how well the AI uses nitro, from 0 to 4
           0 corresponds to no use ; while 1 to 4 corresponds to various degrees
           of quality use (using it immediately for 1 to more context-aware strategies)
         item-skill: Integer determining how well the AI use items, from 0 to 5
           0 corresponds to no use ; 1 to use after a random time ; while 2 to 5 use
           more advanced tactics
         collect-avoid-items: if the AI should collect and avoid items,
           or just ignore them.
         handle-bomb: If the AI should actively try to pass on a bomb.
         skidding-threshold: only for old-style skidding: when sharp turn
           should be triggered. Smaller values means it will sharp turn
           earlier, resulting in better driving in thight curves.
         max-item-angle: Items that would need more than this change in
           direction are not considered for collection.
         time-full-steer is the time for the AI to go from neutral steering to
           extreme left (or right). This can be used to reduce
           'shaking' of AI karts caused by changing steering direction
           too often. It also helps with making it easier to push the
           AI karts (otherwise micro-corrections make this nearly
           impossible). A value of 1/maxFPS / 2 will guarantee that
           the wheel can go from -1 to +1 steering in one frame,
           basically  disabling this mechanism.
         bad-item-closeness is the maximum distance between a good and a
           bad item which can force the AI to abandon a good item in order
           to avoid hitting a bad item. If the distance is larger, it is
           assumed that there will be enough time to change steering
           direction.
         straight-length-for-zipper is the minimum length a straight
           section of the track should have in order to activate a zipper.
           competitive when ahead of the player, or more competitive
           when behind the player.
         skid-probability: Since the AI is usually very good at using
           skidding, this is used to implement some rubber-banding for
           the AI: depending on distance to the player, the AI will
           change the probability of skidding. This attributes takes
           a space-separated list of "distance:probability" pairs
           (negative distances meaning the kart is behind the player,
           a positive number that the AI is ahead of the player).
           Then list should have at least 2 entries. Depending on
           the actualy distance the kart has the probability is then
           linearly interpolated (if the AI is more than the largest
           distance ahead, the value for the largest distance is used,
           and similarly if the kart is more than the minimum value
           behind).
         first-speed-cap: Fraction of maximum speed the first AI kart
           should drive at. Used to slow down karts that are ahead of
           the player. Note that setting this to a value >1 does NOT
           increase the speed the kart can drive at!
         last-speed-cap: same as first-speed-cap, but for last AI kart.
           AI karts in-between use an average of it with first-speed-cap.
         collect-item-probability: Probability of the AI actually
           trying to collect an item (if an item is selected for
           collection in the first place).

    <!-- collision
         impulse-type: STK can apply an additional impulse in case of
           kart-track collision:
             'none' : no additional impulse
             'normal': impulse along the normal
             'driveline': impulse towards the nearest driveline.
           An impulse towards the driveline works nice when the kart is
           driving more or less correctly on the track - it pushes the
           kart in the right direction. But if the kart is significanlty
           off track, it has severe problems (since an incorrect
           driveline point can be selected, pusing the kart in the
           wrong direction, sometimes even causing a 'zip-along-obstacle'
           effect.
         impulse: an additional impulse to be applied in a non-frontal
           collision to push two karts away from each other.
         impulse-time: The impulse will be applied over a certain time
           period, which results in less abrupt changes. If set to 0,
           the impulse is only applied once.
         resitution: restitution value to be used for the kart rigid bodies.
           The restitution used depends on the speed to avoid physics issues
           (a collision with high speed and high restitution will push the
           kart high up into the air). The values specified are
           speed:restitution pairs, the actual restitution will be
           interpolated based on the points specified here.
         bevel-factor: for each point of the chassis collision box one
           additional point is added, resulting in a bevelled box shape.
           The original Z coordinate of the chassis is multiplied by
           1-bevelZ (i.e. the main box part of the shape is shortened).
           The bevel point has the original Z coordinate, and the X and
           Y coordinates of the box are multiplied with (1-bevelX) and
           (1-bevelY).  A value of 0 for all bevel coordinates disables
           bevelling, and uses a simple box shape.
           As an example, a value of 1 for x and z will result in a
           sharp 'arrow' like shape.
         physical-wheel-position: Defines where the 'physical' (raycast)
           wheel will be located. It's a weight factor with 0 = being
           at the widest side of the bevel, 1 = at the front and
           narrowest part of the kart. If the value is less than 0, the old
           physics settings are used which places the raycast wheels
           outside of the chassis and results in more stable physical
           behaviour of the karts. -->

     <!-- Skidding
              increase: multiplicative increase of skidding factor in each frame.
              decrease: multiplicative decrease of skidding factor in each frame.
              max: maximum skidding factor = maximum increase of steering angle.
              time-till-max: Time till maximum skidding is reached.
              visual: Additional graphical rotation of kart. The graphical rotation
                of the kart also determines the direction the kart is driving to
                when skidding is stopped.
              visual-time: How long it takes for the visual skid to reach maximum.
              revert-visual-time: how long it takes when stopping a skid to revert
                the visual skid and bring visuals and physics in sync again.
              min-speed: Minimum speed a kart must have before it can skid. Must be
                >0, otherwise the kart can skid at the start of the race.
              time-till-bonus: How long a kart needs to skid in order to get a bonus.
              bonus-speed: A speedup applied to the kart whick skidded for a while.
              bonus-time: How long the bonus-force is applied.
              bonus-force: Additional engine force (this is used to offset the fact
                that turning after skidding (e.g. to correct direction) often uses
                up the skid bonus).
              post-skid-rotate-factor: a factor to be used to determine how much
                the chassis of a kart should rotate to match the graphical view.
                A factor of 1 is identical, a smaller factor will rotate the kart
                less (which might  feel better).
              physical-jump-time: Time for a physical jump at the beginning of a skid.
              graphical-jump-time: Time for a graphics-only jump at the beginning
                of a skid.
              reduce-turn-min/max: The steering done by the controller (which is in
                [-1,1]) is mapped to [reduce-turn-min, reduce-turn-max] when skidding
                is active (for left turn, right turn will use [-max, -min]). The
                effect is that while you skid (say left) you can adjust the direction
                of the turn the kart is doing somewhat by steering to the left and right,
                but you will always keep on doing a left turn, just more or less. -->
