    <!-- Kart's center point:
        gravity-shift is the shift of the chassis with regards to the center of
                      mass. E.g. with the the value commented out below the 
                      chassis will be 30 cm higher than the  center of mass - 
                      or the center of mass will be 30 cm lower than the  
                      middle of the chassis. So this effectively lowers the 
                      center of mass, making the kart more stable and less 
                      likely to topple over. Default (if nothing is defined 
                      here) is that the center of the mass is at the very bottom

         in between will be interpolated. This allows for tighter turns
         at lower speeds. The actual steering  angle is dependent on the
         wheel base of the kart: radius = wheel_base/sin(steering_angle)
