       smooth-angle-limits: If the angle between the normal of a vertex and
          the normal of a triangle are larger than this value, the normal
          of the triangle will be used in interpolating the normals. This
          has the effect of an edge split modifier - if the flat track and (say)
          a wall at a 90 egree angle are not separated, the normal at that
          vertex will be 45 degrees, resulting in completely wrong physics.
          The angle limit in this case will discard the 45 degrees, and use
          the normal of the flat triangle (pointing upwards). In the worst
          case (all three normals discarded, the interpolation will just
          return the normal of the triangle (i.e. de facto no interpolation),

    <!-- Skidding: increase: multiplicative increase of skidding factor in each frame.
         decrease: multiplicative decrease of skidding factor in each frame.
         max: maximum skidding factor = maximum increase of steering angle.
         time-till-max: Time till maximum skidding is reached.
         visual: Additional graphical rotation of kart. The graphical rotation
           of the kart also determines the direction the kart is driving to
           when skidding is stopped.
         visual-time: How long it takes for the visual skid to reach maximum.
         revert-visual-time: how long it takes when stopping a skid to revert
           the visual skid and bring visuals and physics in sync again.
         angular-velocity: Angular velocity to be used for the kart when skidding.
         min-speed: Minimum speed a kart must have before it can skid. Must be
           >0, otherwise the kart can skid at the start of the race.
         time-till-bonus: How long a kart needs to skid in order to get a bonus.
         bonus-force: A speedup applied to the kart whick skidded for a while.
         bonus-time: How long the bonus-force is applied.
         bonus-force: Additional engine force (this is used to offset the fact
           that turning after skidding (e.g. to correct direction) often uses
           up the skid bonus).
         post-skid-rotate-factor: a factor to be used to determine how much
           the chassis of a kart should rotate to match the graphical view.
           A factor of 1 is identical, a smaller factor will rotate the kart
           less (which might  feel better).
         physical-jump-time: Time for a physical jump at the beginning of a skid.
         graphical-jump-time: Time for a graphics-only jump at the beginning
           of a skid.
         reduce-turn-min/max: The steering done by the controller (which is in
           [-1,1]) is mapped to [reduce-turn-min, reduce-turn-max] when skidding
           is active (for left turn, right turn will use [-max, -min]). The
           effect is that while you skid (say left) you can adjust the direction
           of the turn the kart is doing somewhat by steering to the left and right,
           but you will always keep on doing a left turn, just more or less. -->

    <!-- Kart-specific settings used by the AI.
         use-slipstream: if the AI should try to overtake karts using slipstream.
         disable-slipstream-usage: even if the AI is not trying to use slipstream,
           it can get a lot of bonus, esp. on easy since the AI creates trains.
           Set this to true to make sure AI does not get any slipstream bonus.
         shield-incoming-radius: Radius at which projectiles will be detected and
           trigger a shield usage.
         false-start-probability: Probability of a false start.
         min/max-start-delay: Minimum and maximum start delay.
           See http://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime/stats.php
           Average reaction time is around 0.215 s.
         nitro-usage: "none", "some", "all": if nitro should be used, and
           how much the AI should try to use it good.
         non-random-item-usage: If true, use items in a sophisticated way,
           otherwise use items randomly.
         collect-avoid-items: if the AI should collect and avoid items,
           or just ignore them.
         handle-bomb: If the AI should actively try to pass on a bomb.
         skidding-threshold: only for old-style skidding: when sharp turn
           should be triggered. Smaller values means it will sharp turn
           earlier, resulting in better driving in thight curves.


         max-item-angle: Items that would need more than this change in
           direction are not considered for collection.
         time-full-steer is the time for the AI to go from neutral steering to
           extreme left (or right). This can be used to reduce
           'shaking' of AI karts caused by changing steering direction
           too often. It also helps with making it easier to push the
           AI karts (otherwise micro-corrections make this nearly
           impossible). A value of 1/maxFPS / 2 will guarantee that
           the wheel can go from -1 to +1 steering in one frame,
           basically  disabling this mechanism.
         bad-item-closeness is the maximum distance between a good and a
           bad item which can force the AI to abandon a good item in order
           to avoid hitting a bad item. If the distance is larger, it is
           assumed that there will be enough time to change steering
           direction.
         straight-length-for-zipper is the minimum length a straight
           section of the track should have in order to activate a zipper.

           competitive when ahead of the player, or more competitive
           when behind the player.

         skid-probability: Since the AI is usually very good at using
           skidding, this is used to implement some rubber-banding for
           the AI: depending on distance to the player, the AI will
           change the probability of skidding. This attributes takes
           a space-separated list of "distance:probability" pairs
           (negative distances meaning the kart is behind the player,
           a positive number that the AI is ahead of the player).
           Then list should have at least 2 entries. Depending on
           the actualy distance the kart has the probability is then
           linearly interpolated (if the AI is more than the largest
           distance ahead, the value for the largest distance is used,
           and similarly if the kart is more than the minimum value
           behind).
         speed-cap: Fraction of maximum speed the kart should drive
           at. Used to slow down karts that are ahead of the player.
           Note that setting this to a value >1 does NOT increase
           the speed the kart can drive at!
         collect-item-probability: Probability of the AI actually
           trying to collect an item (if an item is selected for
           collection in the first place).

    <!-- collision
         impulse-type: STK can apply an additional impulse in case of
           kart-track collision:
             'none' : no additional impulse
             'normal': impulse along the normal
             'driveline': impulse towards the nearest driveline.
           An impulse towards the driveline works nice when the kart is
           driving more or less correctly on the track - it pushes the
           kart in the right direction. But if the kart is significanlty
           off track, it has severe problems (since an incorrect
           driveline point can be selected, pusing the kart in the
           wrong direction, sometimes even causing a 'zip-along-obstacle'
           effect.
         impulse: an additional impulse to be applied in a non-frontal
           collision to push two karts away from each other.
         impulse-time: The impulse will be applied over a certain time
           period, which results in less abrupt changes. If set to 0,
           the impulse is only applied once.
         resitution: restitution value to be used for the kart rigid bodies.
         bevel-factor: for each point of the chassis collision box one
           additional point is added, resulting in a bevelled box shape.
           The original Z coordinate of the chassis is multiplied by
           1-bevelZ (i.e. the main box part of the shape is shortened).
           The bevel point has the original Z coordinate, and the X and
           Y coordinates of the box are multiplied with (1-bevelX) and
           (1-bevelY).  A value of 0 for all bevel coordinates disables
           bevelling, and uses a simple box shape.
           As an example, a value of 1 for x and z will result in a
           sharp 'arrow' like shape.
         physical-wheel-position: Defines where the 'physical' (raycast)
           wheel will be located. It's a weight factor with 0 = being
           at the widest side of the bevel, 1 = at the front and
           narrowest part of the kart. If the value is less than 0, the old
           physics settings are used which places the raycast wheels
           outside of the chassis and results in more stable physical
           behaviour of the karts. -->

     <!-- Skidding: increase: multiplicative increase of skidding factor in each frame.
              decrease: multiplicative decrease of skidding factor in each frame.
              max: maximum skidding factor = maximum increase of steering angle.
              time-till-max: Time till maximum skidding is reached.
              visual: Additional graphical rotation of kart. The graphical rotation
                of the kart also determines the direction the kart is driving to
                when skidding is stopped.
              visual-time: How long it takes for the visual skid to reach maximum.
              revert-visual-time: how long it takes when stopping a skid to revert
                the visual skid and bring visuals and physics in sync again.
              angular-velocity: Angular velocity to be used for the kart when skidding.
              min-speed: Minimum speed a kart must have before it can skid. Must be
                >0, otherwise the kart can skid at the start of the race.
              time-till-bonus: How long a kart needs to skid in order to get a bonus.
              bonus-force: A speedup applied to the kart whick skidded for a while.
              bonus-time: How long the bonus-force is applied.
              bonus-force: Additional engine force (this is used to offset the fact
                that turning after skidding (e.g. to correct direction) often uses
                up the skid bonus).
              post-skid-rotate-factor: a factor to be used to determine how much
                the chassis of a kart should rotate to match the graphical view.
                A factor of 1 is identical, a smaller factor will rotate the kart
                less (which might  feel better).
              physical-jump-time: Time for a physical jump at the beginning of a skid.
              graphical-jump-time: Time for a graphics-only jump at the beginning
                of a skid.
              reduce-turn-min/max: The steering done by the controller (which is in
                [-1,1]) is mapped to [reduce-turn-min, reduce-turn-max] when skidding
                is active (for left turn, right turn will use [-max, -min]). The
                effect is that while you skid (say left) you can adjust the direction
                of the turn the kart is doing somewhat by steering to the left and right,
                but you will always keep on doing a left turn, just more or less. -->
