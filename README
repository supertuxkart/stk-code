SuperTuxKart
============
SuperTuxKart is a free kart racing game. It is focusing on fun and
not on realistic kart physics. Instruction can be found on the
in-game help page.

The SuperTuxKart homepage can be found at:

  http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net

The official SuperTuxKart forum is at. If you need support,
this would be the best place to start.

Hope you enjoy the game.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
=====================
* You need a 3D graphics card that supports OpenGL or Mesa.
* You should have a CPU that's running at 450MHz or better.
* You'll need at least 600 MB of free RAM. 
* Ideally, you want a joystick with at least 6 buttons.


COMPILING SuperTuxkart
======================

WINDOWS
-------
A project file for Visual Studio 9 (e.g. the free 2008 express 
edition) is included in the sources in src/ide/vc9. A separate
dependency package is available on SuperTuxKart's sourceforge 
page, which includes all necessary libraries, header files, 
and dlls to compile and run the source code.

While compilation with cygwin is not officially supported,
this has been done (check with the forum for details).

MAC OSX
-------
The latest information about compilation on Mac are on our wiki:
http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/Building_and_packaging_on_OSX
The Xcode project file is in /src/ide/Xcode/, but it still 
requires that all dependencies are installed as explained on the wiki.

UNIX
----
See INSTALL for details.


LICENSE
=======
This software is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) which
can be found in the file 'LICENSE' in the same directory as this file.

3D COORDINATES
==============
A reminder for those looking at the code and 3d models:

STK    : X right, Y up,       Z forwards
Blender: X right, Y forwards, Z up

The exporters perform the needed transform, so in Blender you just work
with XY plane as ground, and things will appear fine in STK (using XZ
as ground in the code, obviously).
