 * \brief This class holds the list of all known devices (ands their configurations), as well as the
 * list of currently plugged (used) devices.
 * It thus takes care of finding to which device any given
 * input belongs, and what action each keypress is bound to, if any (and, since each device is
 * associated to a player, it also finds which player triggered this action)
 * These input mapping capabilities should *only* be used through the InputManager, not directly.
 *
 * The device manager starts in "no-assign" mode, which means no input configuration is associated
 * to any player. So all devices will react. This is used in menus before player set-up is done.
 * Switching back to no-assign mode will also clear anything in devices that was associated with
 * players in assign mode.
