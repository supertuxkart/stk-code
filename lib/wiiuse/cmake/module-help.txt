cmake version 2.8.11.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction

module-help - Reference of available CMake custom modules.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description

The "cmake" executable is the CMake command-line interface.  It may be used
to configure projects in scripts.  Project configuration settings may be
specified on the command line with the -D option.  The -i option will cause
cmake to interactively prompt for such settings.

CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify their
build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each
directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.  Users build a
project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on their
platform.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Custom CMake Modules

The following modules are also available for CMake.  They can be used with
INCLUDE(ModuleName).

  Custom CMake Modules - Additional Modules for CMake.

This is the documentation for additional modules and scripts for CMake.
Using these modules you can check the computer system for installed software
packages, features of the compiler and the existance of headers to name just
a few.

  AboutTheseModules
       Dummy module containing information about these modules for the HELP
       file

       This file documents a snapshot of the cmake-modules available from
       http://github.com/rpavlik/cmake-modules/ The latest version of these
       modules can always be found there.  Additionally, you can find
       instructions on how to integrate these modules into your own project
       either in the README.markdown file in this directory, or on the GitHub
       page listed above (scroll to the bottom to see the README rendered
       attractively).

       In short: Modules of the form "FindSomeName.cmake" are considered to
       be "find modules", and are intended to be used indirectly by calling
       find_package, not by calling include.  Thus, you'll want to do
       something like:

         find_package(SomeName)

       They define a number of variables allowing you to use whatever
       software they search for, such as include directories and libraries.
       A few also define some functions for your use.

       All other modules provide functionality, either immediately upon
       including them, or by defining functions that perform some task of
       varying utility that you can use any time after including them.  Note
       that if a module has the filename, for example,
       cmake/BoostTestTargets.cmake, you only need to call:

         include(BoostTestTargets)

       

       For more information, see the documentation for individual modules,
       the cmake-modules github page, and/or the upstream CMake documentation
       at http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake-2-8-docs.html

  BoostTestTargets
       Add tests using boost::test

       

       Add this line to your test files in place of including a basic boost
       test header:

         #include <BoostTestTargetConfig.h>

       

       If you cannot do that and must use the included form for a given test,
       include the line

         // OVERRIDE_BOOST_TEST_INCLUDED_WARNING

       in the same file with the boost test include.

         include(BoostTestTargets)
         add_boost_test(<testdriver_name> SOURCES <source1> [<more sources...>]
          [FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION <additional fail regex>]
          [LAUNCHER <generic launcher script>]
          [LIBRARIES <library> [<library>...]]
          [RESOURCES <resource> [<resource>...]]
          [TESTS <testcasename> [<testcasename>...]])

       

         If for some reason you need access to the executable target created,
         it can be found in ${${testdriver_name}_TARGET_NAME} as specified when
         you called add_boost_test

       

       Requires CMake 2.6 or newer (uses the 'function' command)

  CleanDirectoryList
       Removes duplicate entries and non-directories from a provided list

       

         clean_directory_list(<listvar> [<additional list items>...])

       

       Requires CMake 2.6 or newer (uses the 'function' command)

  CleanLibraryList
       A smarter replacement for list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES) for library lists

       

       Note that, in the case of cyclic link dependencies, you _do_ actually
       need a library in a list multiple times.  So, only use this function
       when you know that the dependency graph is acyclic.

         clean_library_list(<listvar> [<additional list items>...]) - where
         listvar is the name of a destination variable, and also possibly a source, and
         it is followed by any number (including 0) of additional libraries to append
         to the list before processing.

       

       Removes duplicates from the list, leaving only the last instance,
       while preserving the meaning of the "optimized", "debug", and
       "general" labeling.  (Libraries listed as general are listed in the
       result instead as optimized and debug)

       Requires CMake 2.6 or newer (uses the 'function' command)

  CppcheckTargets
       Run cppcheck on c++ source files as a custom target and a test

       

         include(CppcheckTargets)
         add_cppcheck(<target-name> [UNUSED_FUNCTIONS] [STYLE] [POSSIBLE_ERROR] [FAIL_ON_WARNINGS]) -
           Create a target to check a target's sources with cppcheck and the indicated options
         add_cppcheck_sources(<target-name> [UNUSED_FUNCTIONS] [STYLE] [POSSIBLE_ERROR] [FAIL_ON_WARNINGS]) -
           Create a target to check standalone sources with cppcheck and the indicated options

  CreateDashboardScripts
       Create ctest -S scripts to use to run dashboard builds

       

         include(CreateDashboardScripts)
         create_dashboard_scripts([<initialcachetemplatefilename>])

       

       If you need additional settings to persist from the "parent" CMake
       instance to the initial cache created by the dashboard script, you may
       pass a filename which will be configured into the initial cache.

       In the resulting DASHBOARDSCRIPT_BASE_DIRECTORY, an end-user may
       optionally create a file named

         CustomInitialCache.${DASHBOARDSCRIPT_SCRIPT_NAME}

       (by default, CustomInitialCache.go.cmake) containing set commands that
       use the CACHE option, to set up additional site-local cache variable
       values.

       Requires these CMake modules:

         GetCompilerInfoString

       

       Requires CMake 2.6 or newer (uses the 'function' command)

  CreateImportedTarget
       A smarter replacement for list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES) for library lists

       

         create_imported_target(<libname> [SHARED|STATIC|MODULE] [<library dependency>...]) - where
         ${libname}_LIBRARIES is set to this library's paths.

       

       Removes duplicates from the list then sorts while preserving
       "optimized", "debug", and "general" labeling

         add_file_copy_target(<target_name> <directory to copy to> <filename> [<filename>...])
           Creates a custom target that copies the files to a directory, if needed.
           Relative paths for the destination directory are considered with
           with respect to CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR
           You can use this target in all the usual ways, including
           add_dependencies(some_other_target this_target) to specify that another

          include_directories(${ALUT_WORKAROUND_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${ALUT_INCLUDE_DIRS})
          so you can always #include <AL/al.h> and #include <AL/alut.h> even on
          Mac where the paths might differ.

       

       Requires these CMake modules:

         ADRIENNE_INCLUDE_HAS_EXTERN_C - Some (most) versions of the header already
           wrap their definitions in extern "C" { }, but some do not.

       

         ADRIENNE_DEFINITIONS - defines a quoted ADRIENNE_INCLUDE_FILENAME as above,
           so you can write a line like #include ADRIENNE_INCLUDE_FILENAME
           Also defines ADRIENNE_BEFORE_INCLUDE and ADRIENNE_AFTER_INCLUDE to handle
           adding extern "C" { and } if the header file doesn't do so itself.

       

       Variables that might be set by the user in the gui/command line to
       help find the library:

         ADRIENNE_ROOT_DIR - root of an Adrienne CD, disk, or extracted/copied contents
           thereof.

         FLAGPOLL, the executable: if not defined, do not try to use Flagpoll.

       

       Useful configuration variables you might want to add to your cache:

         FLAGPOLL_ROOT_DIR  - A directory prefix to search for the app
                              (a path that contains bin/ as a subdirectory)

       

       VR Juggler requires this package, so this Find script takes that into

       should "just work." Note that you need to manually re-run CMake if you
       change this environment variable, because it cannot auto-detect this
       change and trigger an automatic re-run.

       You can use Flagpoll to provide directories to use as HINTS for find_*
       These are the provided macros:

         flagpoll_get_include_dirs
         flagpoll_get_library_dirs
         flagpoll_get_library_names
         flagpoll_get_extra_libs

       All take the name of the desired package, optionally NO_DEPS to pass
       --no-deps to Flagpoll, and return
       yourpkgname_FLAGPOLL_INCLUDE_DIRS(etc.  for the other macros).

       Example usage: 	flagpoll_get_include_dirs(vpr NO_DEPS)
       	find_path(VPR20_INCLUDE_DIRS vpr/vpr.h

          	  HINTS  ${vpr_FLAGPOLL_INCLUDE_DIRS})

         GADGETEER20_LIBRARY, the library to link against
         GADGETEER20_FOUND, If false, do not try to use this library.

       

       Plural versions refer to this library and its dependencies, and are
       recommended to be used instead, unless you have a good reason.

       Useful configuration variables you might want to add to your cache:

         GADGETEER20_ROOT_DIR - A directory prefix to search
                                (a path that contains include/ as a subdirectory)

       

       This script will use Flagpoll, if found, to provide hints to the
       location of this library, but does not use the compiler flags returned
       by Flagpoll directly.

       The VJ_BASE_DIR environment variable is also searched (preferentially)
       when searching for this component, so most sane build environments
       should "just work." Note that you need to manually re-run CMake if you
       change this environment variable, because it cannot auto-detect this
       change and trigger an automatic re-run.

  FindIDLJ
       try to find Java's IDLJ Interface Definition Language compiler.

       

       Ideally used with CMake 2.8.5 or newer for Java support using
       FindJava.cmake and UseJava.cmake

       Variables:

         Java_IDLJ_COMMAND, executable for idlj
         IDLJ_FOUND, If false, do not try to use this

       

       Function:

         java_idlj(varname idlfile [extra idlj args]) - Generates
           the Java source files from the IDL file you indicate, and
           appends filenames suitable to add to a add_jar() call to the
           variable you specified.

       

       Because the files generated from an IDL file are not entirely
       predictable, java_idlj runs idlj in the cmake step, rather than the
       build step, and triggers a CMake re-run when an idl file is modified.
       Already up-to-date generated source is not re-generated, however.

       Files are generated in a directory created specifically for the
       particular IDL file and the particular call, in the build directory -
       there should be no worries about overwriting files or picking up too
       much with the wildcard.

       You may wish to add the IDL file to your list of sources if you want
       it to appear in your IDE, but it is not necessary.

       Requires VPR 2.0 and GMTL (thus FindVPR20.cmake and FindGMTL.cmake)

       This library is a part of VR Juggler 2.2 - you probably want to use
       find_package(VRJuggler22) instead, for an easy interface to this and
       related scripts.  See FindVRJuggler22.cmake for more information.

       Plural versions refer to this library and its dependencies, and are
       recommended to be used instead, unless you have a good reason.

       Useful configuration variables you might want to add to your cache:

         SONIX12_ROOT_DIR - A directory prefix to search
                            (a path that contains include/ as a subdirectory)

       

       This script will use Flagpoll, if found, to provide hints to the
       location of this library, but does not use the compiler flags returned
       by Flagpoll directly.

       The VJ_BASE_DIR environment variable is also searched (preferentially)
       when searching for this component, so most sane build environments
       should "just work." Note that you need to manually re-run CMake if you
       change this environment variable, because it cannot auto-detect this
       change and trigger an automatic re-run.

  FindTR1

       Once done, this will define

         TR1_USE_FILE, which you may "include" in your CMake file to be able
          to use TR1 features transparently
         TR1_INCLUDE_DIRS, any directories needed to access TR1 headers
         TR1_LIBRARY_DIRS, any directories needed to access (auto-link) TR1 libraries
         TR1_FOUND, If false, do not try to use TR1 features.

       

       If TR1 features are not built-in, we will try to use Boost to
       substitute for them.

       This script will use Flagpoll, if found, to provide hints to the
       location of this library, but does not use the compiler flags returned
       by Flagpoll directly.

       The VJ_BASE_DIR environment variable is also searched (preferentially)

       should "just work." Note that you need to manually re-run CMake if you

       change and trigger an automatic re-run.

         VRJUGGLER_FOUND, If false, do not try to use VR Juggler.

       

       Components available to search for (uses "VRJOGL" by default):

         VRJOGL
         VRJ
         Gadgeteer
         JCCL
         VPR
         Sonix
         Tweek

       

       Additionally, a full setup requires these packages and their
       Find_.cmake scripts

         CPPDOM
         GMTL

       

       Optionally uses Flagpoll (and FindFlagpoll.cmake)

       Notes on components:

         - All components automatically include their dependencies.
         - If you do not specify a component, VRJOGL (the OpenGL view manager)
           will be used by default.
         - Capitalization of component names does not matter, but it's best to
           pretend it does and use the above capitalization.
         - Since this script calls find_package for your requested components and
           their dependencies, you can use any of the variables specified in those
           files in addition to the "summary" ones listed here, for more finely
           controlled building and linking.

       

       This CMake script requires all of the Find*.cmake scripts for the
       components listed above, as it is only a "meta-script" designed to
       make using those scripts more developer-friendly.

       Useful configuration variables you might want to add to your cache:

         (CAPS COMPONENT NAME)_ROOT_DIR - A directory prefix to search
                                (a path that contains include/ as a subdirectory)

       

       The VJ_BASE_DIR environment variable is also searched (preferentially)
       when seeking any of the above components, as well as Flagpoll, CPPDOM,
       and Boost (from within VPR), so most sane build environments should
       "just work."

       IMPORTANT: Note that you need to manually re-run CMake if you change
       this environment variable, because it cannot auto-detect this change
       and trigger an automatic re-run.

  StampSourcesWithVersion
       It will only attempt a substitution within the first C-style comment
       block

       

       To set up your source code for proper stamping, start your file with a
       Doxygen-style comment block, starting with /* and ending with */ On a
       line by itself, with unimportant whitespace, add the standard Doxygen
       "version" command:

         @version xxx

       or

         \version xxx

       

       To make sure it works, please do actually put xxx as the current
       version: when you save, add one of the command below to your cmake
       build, and run cmake, it should replace xxx with the current version.
       (It replaces anything between the end of the whitespace after \version
       and the end of the line with the version that you pass in your build
       script, so put nothing else on that line!)

       For <version>, I recommend passing the value of a CMake variable like

         ${CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION}

       Remember, reduced duplication of information means reduced errors!

       WARNING! This does edit your source directory, but will only execute
       if the (hidden/advanced, default OFF) variable ENABLE_VERSION_STAMPING
       is on.

       Additionally, it tries to be very careful: of your code (that is, the
       first /* */), but only if // is not found first

         stamp_target_with_version(<version> <target_name> [HEADERS_ONLY | <source>...]) -
          If no source file is specified, all will be processed.

       

         stamp_sources_with_version(<version> <source> [<source> ...]) -
          Use for files not directly associated with a target.

  UseBackportedModules
       Do a version-dependent check and auto-include backported modules dirs

       

       Name your module directories cmake-*-modules where * is the full
       (maj.min.patch) version number that they came from.  You can use
       subdirectories within those directories, if you like - all directories
       inside of a cmake-*-modules dir for a newer version of CMake that what
       we're running, that contain one or more .cmake files, will be appended
       to the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.

       When backporting modules, be sure to test them and follow copyright
       instructions (usually updating copyright notices)

       Requires these CMake modules:

         CleanDirectoryList
