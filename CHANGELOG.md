# Changelog
This file documents notable changes to SuperTuxKart across versions since its inception.

It should be kept in mind that some versions have a less complete changelog than others, and that this changelog does not list the details of the many small bugfixes and improvements which together make a significant part of the progress between releases.

For similar reasons, and because some features are vastly more complex than others, attributions of main changes should not be taken as a shortcut for overall contribution.
